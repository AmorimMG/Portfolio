Author's description:

There is my favourite color. The green version of the '''Oxy-Neon Green''' cursor set. This green outline is light green but green enough not to be classified as a pastel green. This cursor set is based on the '''Oxy-Neon''' cursors from this series. There are 16 cursor roles altogether. There are two of those cursors which have been animated to show waiting actions.
